    "### Introduction\n",
    "Over the past few decades, digital technology has advanced more rapidly than any other human innovation and has reached the point where our society is almost completely dependent on it. The increasing volume of data, as a consequence of such advancement, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry(IBM, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular field where the importance of data science has skyrocketed is the gaming industry. With the use of data, developers can patterns and preferences, enabling them enhance the gaming experince of the players(Whitehead, 2024). Data science helps gaming companies develop \"effective monetisation strategies\" (Whitehead, 2024) by examining the spending patterns of the players and forecasting behaviour. In this porject, data science methods will be used to explore a dataset, extracted from the Minecraft server, in an attempt to predict the time windows where player activity patterns are high. Using these predictions will allow better allocation of server licenses. The data, collected by a research group in Computer Science led by Frank Wood at UBC Point Grey Campus, will be used to answer the question: which day of the week is a player most likely to log on based on their age, gender and experience?\n",

    "#### Data Description: identify and fully describe the dataset that was used to answer the question. Provide a full descriptive summary of the dataset, including information such as the number of observations, summary statistics, number of variables, name and type of variables, what the variables mean, any issues you see in the data, any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see, how the data were collected, etc. Make sure to use bullet point lists or tables to summarize the variables in an easy-to-understand format. Note that the selected dataset(s) will probably contain more variables than you need. "
