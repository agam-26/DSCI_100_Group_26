    "## Predicting time windows with high-demand usage for efficient allocation of licenses\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Over the past few decades, digital technology has advanced more rapidly than any other human innovation and has reached the point where our society is almost completely dependent on it. The increasing volume of data, as a consequence of such advancement, has made data science one of the fastest growing fields across every industry(IBM, 2021). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular field where the importance of data science has skyrocketed is the gaming industry. With the use of data, developers can identify patterns and preferences, enabling them to enhance the gaming experience for players(Whitehead, 2024). Data science helps gaming companies develop \"effective monetisation strategies\" (Whitehead, 2024) by examining the spending patterns of the players and forecasting thier behaviour. In this project, data science methods will be used to explore a dataset, extracted from the Minecraft server, in an attempt to predict the time windows where player activity patterns are high. Using these predictions will allow better allocation of server licenses. The data, collected by a research group in Computer Science led by Frank Wood at UBC Point Grey Campus, will be used to answer the question: Which day of the week is a player most likely to log on based on their age, gender and experience? <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive analysis will help companies understand player usage patterns and allow them to determine the allocation of licenses during different time windows throughout the week. To answer the question, two datasets were used: players.csv and sessions.csv. These datasets were merged using a common identifier, hashedEmail, to be able to view player characteristics along with their session timings. <br><br>\n",
    "##### Dataset 1: Player Details (players.csv) <br>\n",
    "This dataset contains information about the players registered with the Minecraft server. Each row represents observations about a unique player.<br>\n",
    "Number of observations - 196<br>\n",
    "Number of variables - 7<br><br>\n",
    "##### Dataset 2: Session Details (sessions.csv) <br>\n",
    "This dataset contains information about the players' sessions along with the start and end of session timestamp<br>\n",
    "Number of observations - 1534<br>\n",
    "Number of variables - 5<br><br>\n",
    "##### Variables <br>\n",
    "1. hashedEmail(chr): A unique, anonymized identifier for each player, containing encrypted email addresses to protect their privacy.<br>\n",
    "2. name(chr): The name of the players registered with the server<br>\n",
    "3. gender(chr): The players' self identified gender (Male, Female, Non-binary, Two-Spirited, Prefer not to say, Agender, Other)<br>\n",
    "4. experience(chr): Player's experience level (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Pro, Veteran)<br>\n",
    "5. Age(dbl): Age of the player. (Age range is from 8-50)<br>\n",
    "6. subscribe(lgl): Whether the player has subscribed to the newsletter or not. (TRUE/FALSE)<br>\n",
    "7. played_hours(dbl): Total hours played by a player (ranging from 0 - 225)<br>\n",
    "8. start_time(chr) - timestamp for the start of each player's session (reported as date and time - Day/Month/Year Hour:Minute)<br>\n",
    "9. end_time(chr) - timestamp for the end of each player's session (reported as date and time - Day/Month/Year Hour:Minute)<br>\n",
    "10. original_start_time(dbl)- session start time stamp reported in milliseconds<br>\n",
    "11. original_end_time(dbl)- session end time stamp reported in milliseconds<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Summary characteristics - \n",
    "- Most of the players reported their gender as male.\n",
    "- The mean age of players is around 20.52 years, with most players being around 19 years of age.\n",
    "- Most of the players are at the Amateur experience level(63), while only 14 players are at the Pro experience level.\n",
